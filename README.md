SimpleResponsiveNavigation
==========================

This uses jQuery to make a simple mobile nav that slides up and down. It is a bit too simple to use in full scale production. The main flaw is that if you hide the nav at mobile size and then increase the screen size to where the full nav is shown then the nav will still be hidden. 

There is another example Simple Responsive Navigation with Modernizr JS Media Queries that fixes this problem
